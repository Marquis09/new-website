        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The MMU TV website was created as a platform to showcase creative projects from Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) students and staff. The goal of the website was to make it easy for users to explore videos, sign up, and engage with the MMU community.</p>

    <section class="container mt-5" style="max-width: 900px;">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>When starting this project, there were several challenges to overcome, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of a clear, modern layout for displaying content.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the website was mobile-friendly and accessible.</li>
            <li>Creating a simple but functional search feature for video content.</li>
            <li>Developing an intuitive user experience that caters to both students and staff.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Design Goals -->
    <section class="container mt-5" style="max-width: 900px;">
        <h2>Design Goals</h2>
        <p>The primary objectives for the website redesign were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a responsive, mobile-first design for easy access on all devices.</li>
            <li>Develop an intuitive navigation system that allows users to quickly find and view videos.</li>
            <li>Ensure the website meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Create visually appealing and engaging content sections to showcase MMU‚Äôs creative work.</li>

    <!-- Development Process -->
    <section class="container mt-5" style="max-width: 900px;">
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>The website was built using HTML5, CSS3, and the Bootstrap framework for responsive design. Below are the key steps taken during development:</p>

        <!-- Homepage Design -->
        <h3>Homepage Design</h3>
        <p>The homepage features a full-width hero image, a brief introduction, and a section highlighting featured videos. The layout is simple, with easy navigation to key pages like "Categories" and "Sign Up".</p>

        <br><br>

        <!-- Mobile Responsiveness -->
        <h3>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>One of the main focuses was to make the site fully responsive. By utilizing Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system, the website automatically adjusts for devices of any size, ensuring a seamless experience on phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>

        <!-- Search Functionality -->
        <h3>Search Functionality</h3>
        <p>To enhance user experience, I implemented a simple search bar that suggests results as users type. This feature makes it easier to find specific videos and categories.</p>

        <h3>Sign-Up Page</h3>
