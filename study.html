    <!-- Overview Section -->

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As a frequent traveler, I noticed there was a lack of a centralized platform where tourists could easily access all the essential information they need when visiting Munich, Germany. I saw an opportunity to create a user-friendly, all-in-one website that would offer tourists a seamless experience, helping them navigate attractions, events, and cultural highlights while they explore the city.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Munich Travel Guide is to make it easier for tourists to plan and enjoy their trip to Munich by consolidating all relevant tourist information in one mobile-responsive platform. By focusing on usability and accessibility, this website aims to offer the best experience for both local and international visitors.</p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <section class="container mt-5" style="max-width: 900px;">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>When researching Munich for my own travels, I found that there was no single platform that combined all the essential tourist information. Websites were fragmented, requiring users to jump between multiple pages to find details on attractions, events, or dining recommendations. Furthermore, many of these websites were not mobile-friendly, making it difficult for tourists to access information while exploring the city.</p>
        <p>This fragmented experience made it harder for tourists to plan their trips effectively and enjoy their visit. I wanted to create a solution that consolidated everything into one platform‚Äîaccessible on any device and easy to navigate.</p>

    <section class="container mt-5" style="max-width: 900px;">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>To create an engaging and functional website, I followed a structured design process that included the following stages:</p>

        <h3>1. Research</h3>
        <p>I began by studying the needs of potential users‚Äîtourists visiting Munich. I reviewed existing tourism websites to identify gaps and opportunities. In addition, I performed a survey to gather insights from people who had visited Munich and understood what they would expect from a tourism website.</p>

        <h3>2. Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
        <p>After gathering feedback, I created wireframes and prototypes to outline the website‚Äôs layout. The focus was to ensure easy navigation and logical categorization of content, such as major tourist attractions, events, food and dining, and local culture. These wireframes helped visualize the site before diving into detailed design and development.</p>

            </div>
        </a>

        <h3>3. User Testing</h3>
        <p>I tested the prototypes with potential users to gather feedback. This allowed me to make adjustments and improvements to the user interface to ensure that the site would meet the needs of tourists on-the-go.</p>
